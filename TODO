Rake Todo:
  rake flickr:keys API_KEY, API_SECRET    # Generates 'config/flickr.yml' in proper format
  rake flickr:clear                       # Simply deletes the 'config/flickr.yml' file

  Rake Deployment Tasks:
  - set database YAML file because I pulled it out of the repository
  - Heroku deployment
